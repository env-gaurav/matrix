# matrix
## Element access:
You can access individual elements in a matrix using double indexing. For example, matrix[i][j] would access the element at row i and column j.

## Element modification:
You can modify individual elements in a matrix. For example, matrix[i][j] = value would modify the element at row i and column j with the value value.

## Matrix addition:
You can add two matrices together element-wise. For example, matrix1 + matrix2 would add the corresponding elements of matrix1 and matrix2.

## Matrix subtraction:
You can subtract one matrix from another element-wise. For example, matrix1 - matrix2 would subtract the corresponding elements of matrix2 from matrix1.

## Matrix multiplication: 
You can multiply a matrix by a scalar or another matrix. For example, matrix * scalar would multiply each element of matrix by the scalar scalar.

## Matrix transpose: 
You can transpose a matrix, which flips the rows and columns. For example, matrix.transpose() would transpose the matrix

## Matrix multiplication: 
You can multiply two matrices together. For example, matrix1 @ matrix2 would perform matrix multiplication between matrix1 and matrix2.
